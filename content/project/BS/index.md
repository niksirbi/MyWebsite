## Summary
Deeply anesthetized and comatose states are often accompanied by a distinctive pattern of
electroencephalographic activity, called “Burst Suppression”. This pattern’s underlying mechanism and
functional significance remain largely unknown. I explore how Burst Suppression manifests itself in fMRi data
obtained from from both humans and animals (non-human primates, rats).
